# Webblog Project Week 7 Java Fall 2018

Java Webblog Project with Spring Boot, Hibernate, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf in Week 7 @AWAcademy Java Fall 2018. 

This Project was created after 7 weeks of intensive training at the Java Fall 2018 Program of [AWAcademy](https://www.awacademy.de) by [Academic Work](https://www.academicwork.de).

The Project settings are by default set to use a MariaDB running on Port 3306. You need to create a database called "weblog" and the User/Password settings are by default set to "root/root".

The easiest way to run the Project is in an IDE like Intellij. The webserver Port is 8080. The first user to signup will automatically be assigned to be Admin.
